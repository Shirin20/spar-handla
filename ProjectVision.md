## Background and Problem Description

There are multiple grocery stores with varying food prices and offers, making it difficult to always know if one is purchasing the right food at the right price. To find what one is looking for, one needs to search and compare on different websites, potentially ending up with multiple shopping lists for different grocery stores and wasting time. Alternatively, some might find it cumbersome and decide to buy everything from one or two stores, missing out on saving money.

## User/Target Groups:   
- Those who usually shop at various grocery stores, spanning different ages, from teenagers to the elderly, specifically those who prefer shopping in person.

## Market  
- There exists a service like martspar.se that also offers a price comparison service, but it does not provide the ability to create a shopping list. Its target audience is those who shop and order food online, whereas my app targets those who shop in person.

## Basic Requirements/Features/Unique Selling Points  
- The app to be programmed will help the user to;  
  **Save time**: by searching for the best prices from various food websites in one place.  
  **Save money**: by presenting a price comparison service for food.  
  **Organize user's shopping list** according to the stores from which one will purchase.  

## Technology  
- I will use Nginx, Node.js, Express, HTML/CSS, MongoDB, and expand my knowledge of CSS and learn React.
